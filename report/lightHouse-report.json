[Learn more about proper list structure](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/list).Unscored\n\nList items (`<li>`) are contained within `<ul>`, `<ol>` or `<menu>` parent elements\n\nScreen readers require list items (`<li>`) to be contained within a parent `<ul>`, `<ol>` or `<menu>` to be announced properly. [Learn more about proper list structure](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/listitem).Unscored\n\n`<object>` elements have alternative text\n\nScreen readers cannot translate non-text content. Adding alternative text to `<object>` elements helps screen readers convey meaning to users. [Learn more about alt text for `object` elements](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/object-alt).Unscored\n\nSelect elements have associated label elements.\n\nForm elements without effective labels can create frustrating experiences for screen reader users. [Learn more about the `select` element](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/select-name).Unscored\n\nSkip links are focusable.\n\nIncluding a skip link can help users skip to the main content to save time. [Learn more about skip links](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/skip-link).Unscored\n\nNo element has a `[tabindex]` value greater than 0\n\nA value greater than 0 implies an explicit navigation ordering. Although technically valid, this often creates frustrating experiences for users who rely on assistive technologies. [Learn more about the `tabindex` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/tabindex).Unscored\n\n`<th>` elements and elements with `[role=\"columnheader\"/\"rowheader\"]` have data cells they describe.\n\nScreen readers have features to make navigating tables easier. Ensuring that table headers always refer to some set of cells may improve the experience for screen reader users. [Learn more about table headers](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/th-has-data-cells).Unscored\n\n`[lang]` attributes have a valid value\n\n`<video>` elements contain a `<track>` element with `[kind=\"captions\"]`\n\nWhen a video provides a caption it is easier for deaf and hearing-impaired users to access its information. [Learn more about video captions](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/video-caption).Unscored\n\nTables have different content in the summary attribute and `<caption>`.\n\nThe summary attribute should describe the table structure, while `<caption>` should have the onscreen title. Accurate table mark-up helps users of screen readers. [Learn more about summary and caption](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/table-duplicate-name).Unscored\n\nAll heading elements contain content.\n\nA heading with no content or inaccessible text prevents screen reader users from accessing information on the page's structure. [Learn more about headings](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/empty-heading).Unscored\n\nUses ARIA roles only on compatible elements\n\nMany HTML elements can only be assigned certain ARIA roles. Using ARIA roles where they are not allowed can interfere with the accessibility of the web page. [Learn more about ARIA roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-allowed-role).Unscored\n\nImage elements do not have `[alt]` attributes that are redundant text.\n\nInformative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternative text. Alternative text that is exactly the same as the text adjacent to the link or image is potentially confusing for screen reader users, because the text will be read twice. [Learn more about the `alt` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/image-redundant-alt).Unscored\n\nIdentical links have the same purpose.\n\nLinks with the same destination should have the same description, to help users understand the link's purpose and decide whether to follow it.

This includes avoiding [mixed content](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr), where some resources are loaded over HTTP despite the initial request being served over HTTPS. HTTPS prevents intruders from tampering with or passively listening in on the communications between your app and your users, and is a prerequisite for HTTP/2 and many new web platform APIs.
